#### 2000 to 2005

I was about one or two years of age when I started using the computer. I first started downloading and setting wallpapers when I was about 2 years of age. I played games at the age of 3. That was around 2002. I started messing with text editors and files in around 2005 I think. (Not entirely sure though, but I started editing files in the text editor on Windows at around the time I think).

#### 2006 to 2009

In the time that followed I may have started messing more with games, downloading, and so on. In this time mostly nothing important happened, though, as I was limited in what I could do on the computer. I tried to see how my older brother changed the time left on the computer but I didn't figure it out pretty much.

#### 2010 to 2015

At around 2010 I had used the computer a lot for school and I got my first smartphone. In the years that followed I started messing around with C, HTML, BASIC, and more. I also started using Linux intensively at this time. This post will get updated to add images and such. I also started to gain an interest in computer security, I will update this post to add extra information.
